         <h3> Let me explain that I still don’t know my exact graduation path. 
            Therefore, my journey may seem a bit broad, but I am interested in finding out 
            what I really want to do in university and in the future. However, since I already like computer systems, 
            I am confident that I have the skills and interest to study them, and I have the opportunity to develop 
            the knowledge and skills needed for the future. 
            in order to prepare myself to confidently enter the working world.</h3>

             <p>In my first year, I focused on adjusting to university life, learning how to study and manage my time effectively, 
                Including collecting basic knowledge about important basic subjects to enhance knowledge in the field of study 
                and setting goals to get good scores in every subject.</p>

                 <p>Set goals to do your homework and get high scores as usual, but maybe add in a more intensive self-discovery to fully realize your interests.</p>
                    <img src="resources/Year3.png" alt="Year3" class="Year3Article" width="200" height="75">
                     <p>As usual, when studying hard, this year I had to prepare for an internship to gain experience 
                        and try to talk to teachers and seniors to gather information.</p>
                        <img src="resources/Year4.png" alt="Year4" class="Year4Article" width="200" height="75">
                         <p>This year, we have to see if we are doing an internship or a project. If we are doing an internship, 
                            we have to prepare ourselves for the pressure ahead. But if we are doing a project, we have to gather 
                            more information to make it as complete as possible.</p>
