                 <h3>My Old Story</h3><!--Choose 1 consequences-->
                 <p>I am a person who lives an ordinary life. There is nothing special at almost all times that past away. I have a family in my house, a small 
                     family, father, mother and me, as in the picture. I think the picture can tell everyone that my family raised me in a relaxed way.</p>

             <div id="mypersonal" class="content" style="display:none;">
                 <h3>My Personal</h3><!--Choose 2 consequences-->
                 <p>I tend to be sleepy all the time. I am not a good looker, I have a bad taste in my mouth, 
                    I am a person who is always serious, and I am not good at reading other people's feelings. So I want everyone to speak out, 
                    which I think no one wants to say it but that's just me.</p>
             </div>
             <div id="mystyle" class="content" style="display:none;">
                 <h3>My Style</h3><!--Choose 3 consequences-->
                 <p>I am a very chill person. If you get used to my seriousness, when I am not serious, I am always ready for everything. Go anywhere, anytime, 
                    like 7-11. I am a person who does not care much about whether I look good or not, as long as I am comfortable. 
                    I like to play games without any reason. And that is one of the reasons why I am interested in tech and why am here.</p>

            <h4>Hello, I'm Chanakan Kongratchapinyo 6709650235. This clip introduces myself. There's nothing much. I was born into a family of 3 people: 
                father, mother and son. During high school, I was just an ordinary kid, cheerful. Honestly, I'm not. In my free time, I play on the computer in front of me. 
                I can play Rubik's Cube, but I've forgotten some things. I read books. I have a lot of them, but I can't finish them. Honestly, I'm a shy person, 
                but I like being with friends. As for music, I like it like this. Personally, I'm a bit too serious. But if I lose my mind, I'll go far. As for the end, 
                I'd like to introduce myself to everyone.</h4>
